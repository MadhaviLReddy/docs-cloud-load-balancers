Create a cloud server
=========================

Create a new cloud server (or use an
existing cloud server) to set up as a member for your load balancer. The instructions 
are for the `Cloud Control Panel <http://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__. You can also create a server by using the Cloud Servers API. See the `Cloud Servers API Developer Guide <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/v2/developer-guide/>`__ for details.


#. Log in to the `Cloud Control Panel <http://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__.

#. If the Cloud Servers page is not automatically displayed, click 
   **Servers > Cloud Servers** at the top of the panel. 
   
   If you are creating a new server, proceed with the next step. If you are using an
   existing server, skip to the last step.

#. On the Cloud Servers page, click **Create Server**.

#. Select the region, and specify a name for the server. 

#. Select an image from the list of operating systems.

#. Specify the flavor for the server.

#. Click **Create Server**. 

#. After your server is created, return to the Cloud Servers page, where all of your
   servers are listed.

#. From the Cloud Servers page of the Cloud Control Panel, record the IP address of 
   your server. You will need this address in a later section (when adding a member 
   to a pool).
