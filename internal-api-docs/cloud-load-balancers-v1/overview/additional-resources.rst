Two APIs provide access to the Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers service:

-  The administration API, available only to developers within Rackspace, is
   the subject of this document.

-  The public API, available to developers within Rackspace and
   Rackspace customers, is the subject of a companion document, the
   *Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers Developer Guide*. You can download 
   the current version of the public guide at :rax-devdocs:`API Developer documentation <>`.
