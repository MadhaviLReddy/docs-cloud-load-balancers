Create a New Cloud Server
=========================

In this section you create two new Cloud Servers (or use two
existing Cloud Servers) to set up as nodes for your load balancer.

.. note::
   If you are using existing Cloud Servers on your account, skip Steps 1-5
   and go directly to Step 6 below.

Create a Cloud Server using the Cloud Servers section of the Cloud
Control Panel (login here: `Cloud Control
Panel <http://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__).

.. note::
   You can also create a Cloud Server using the Cloud Servers API. Refer to
   the `Cloud Servers API Developer Guide <http://developer.rackspace.com/>`__
   for details.

#. Click Servers to view the Cloud Servers page.

#. Using the Region drop-down menu, select the appropriate region,
   depending on whether you want to create a first generation Cloud
   Server or a next generation Cloud Server. (The type of Cloud Server
   does not matter for this exercise.)

#. Select an image from a list of different operating systems, including
   Linux Distributions and Windows Images:

   |image0|

#. Specify the Server Name and select a Size for your Cloud Server, then
   click Create Server.

#. Create a second Cloud Server by performing Steps 1-4 again.

#. Record the IP addresses of your Cloud Servers below (from the
   information displayed in the Cloud Servers section of the Cloud
   Control Panel):

   -  FIRST Cloud Server IP Address =
      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

   -  SECOND Cloud Server IP Address =
      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
