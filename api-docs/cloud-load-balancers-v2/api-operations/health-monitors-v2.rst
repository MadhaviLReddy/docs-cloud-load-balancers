Health MonitorsÂ 
=====================


The load balancing service includes a health monitoring operation that
periodically checks your back-end members to ensure they are responding
correctly. If a member does not respond, it is removed from rotation
until the *health monitor* determines that the member is
functional. In addition to being performed periodically, the health
check also is performed against every member that is added to ensure
that the member is operating properly before allowing it to service
traffic. Only one health monitor is allowed to be enabled on a load
balancer at a time.
