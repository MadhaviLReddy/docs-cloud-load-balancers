======================================
**Extended API Reference**
======================================

These API operations relate to support of load balancing service 
activities on behalf of a specific customer. The scope of these 
operations is narrow, relating to the needs of a single customer. 
A customer might directly request these operations but only Rackers 
are authorized to perform them. Rackers might also perform these 
operations to limit or terminate a specific customer's activities 
when that customer appears to be disrupting the overall operational 
environment.
