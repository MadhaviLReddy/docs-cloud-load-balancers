General API information
-------------------------

Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. See the API
Operations chapter for details about specific operations.

The Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers API is implemented using a ReSTful web
service interface. Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the
load balancing service shares a common token-based authentication system
that allows seamless access between products and services.

.. note::
    All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using
    HTTPS on TCP port 443. For authentication instructions, see
    :ref:`Authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud <authenticate-to-cloud>`.
