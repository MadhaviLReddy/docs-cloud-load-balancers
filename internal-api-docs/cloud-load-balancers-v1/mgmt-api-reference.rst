**Management API Reference**
======================================

These API operations relate to administration of the environment 
that enables and supports the load balancing service for all customers. 
The scope of these operations is wide, relating to the overall 
operating environment rather than to a single customer. Rackers 
might perform these operations to examine or alter the overall 
operational environment.
