Associations between load balancers and host machinesÂ 
===============================================================

Service administrators may re-assign a load balancer to a different host machine within the same cluster. This action can be taken if capacity warrants it or if a particular configuration needs to be isolated from others within the environment. Both active and failover hosts may be changed.

Additionally, this operation allows for a service administrator to define a load balancer's host configurations as being "sticky" that prohibits the system from automatically moving this configuration between hosts to balance the host performance.

A load balancer that is defined as being ``ACTIVE`` on multiple hosts allows the load balancer host machines to service traffic for a single VIP across multiple systems. This is an advanced feature that should be used cautiously as it can potentially amplify DDoS and other types of malicious traffic.
